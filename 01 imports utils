this is how it should be migrasted:

1 INST-Create Claim (Verify) Procedure Codes (UB04 Form Tab Box 74a-e)
             User ID: TAM-111224   Password: Keepout!1                                                                                                          CC2-9074                                      
 
Given an External User logs into CCtr
and access Claims > Create a Claim > Institutional
When the user goes to UB04 Form tab > 74 Principal Procedure Code field
Then the field has a lookup functionality to allow the user to search by code or description
            and in a box above the field, code, then description displays, sorted by description, ascending
            Example from Professional:
                
 
and repeat for UB04 Form tab > Other Procedure fields (74a-74e)
